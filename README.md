# Hello World
 Github Intro
 
 I am Jordan Miracle. This is my first time working with repositories in Github. 
 The human on the couch behind me is my soul mate.
 It proves to me that whether it's fate, cosmic intervention,
 or some odd interaction involving superposition and quantum entanglement, 
 some things are just meant to happen.
 Kaiju is laying in his box tent in front of me, and Bastet is in the bedroom.
 I drink a lot of tea..
